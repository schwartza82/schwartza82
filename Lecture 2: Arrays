//Figuring out grade level for a text

//Cipher text = the result of encrypting a piece of information (cryptography)

//Consider hello world in C

#include <studio.h>

int main(void)
{
  printf("hello, world\n");
}

//Make in "make hello" is NOT a compiler but a program that automates the process of using an actual compiler
- Actual compiler is called "clang" for "c language"

ls a.out
- a.out = assembler output and is the default name of a program when you print out from just running clang by itself
- can rename a.out by using the Linux command mv or can use a COMMAND LINE ARGUMENT

Command Line Argument = additional word or key phrase that you type after a command at your prompt in your terminal window that just modifies the behavior of that command

Use:
clang -o hello hello.c
// -o means change clang's output to be a file called hello instead of a.out

Clang -o hello hello.c in code with user input aspect:

#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)

{

    string name = get_string("What's your name?\n");
    printf("hello, %s\n", name);
}

Gets error: /usr/bin/ld: /tmp/hello-9d456f.o: in function `main':
hello.c:(.text+0x16): undefined reference to `get_string'
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
