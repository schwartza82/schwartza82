#why pandas?
- more flexibility than in excel
- pandas lets you work with larger datasets!

#loading data into pandas (assuming you've already installed in in pip install pandas)
#if csv is in the same folder/location that you're writing your code, you can just put the "name_of_the_file.csv"
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read.csv('pokemon_data.csv')

#print to see the first 3 rows of data
print(df.head(3)

#using .txt as only argumenet in .read_csv() function will get a really big column (bad) so need to specify what's seperating it
df = pd.read_csv('pokemon_data.txt, delimiter = '\t')

#Reading Data in Pandas

#Reading headers
print(df.columns)

#Read each column
#here we want the first five enteries in the name column 
print(df['Name'][0:5])

#for multiple columns, make a list of column names
print(df[['Name', 'Type 1', 'HP']]

#Reading each row
#iloc means integer location of row 
print(df.iloc[1])

#iterating through each row as you read it
for index, row in df.iterrows():
  print(index,row)

#Read a specific location (Row,Column)
print(df.iloc[2,1])
